# Mapper between Vienna Development Method (VDM++) and Java Modelling Language (JML)

This project was a part of my MSc thesis. The goal was to be able to
convert specifications written in VDM++ to JML and vice-versa. 

The code was written using VDM++ and code generated to Java, as a part
of the [Overture](http://www.overturetool.org/) project.
